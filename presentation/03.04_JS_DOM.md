JavaScript is good at many thing but what it does best is manipulation the DOM.

You can use plain JavaScript (Vanilla JS) or you can use a framework to perform DOM specific actions.

Our framework of choice for manipulating the DOM will be jQuery. We well do some side-by-side examples just to se why you should use a framework like jQuery when interacting with the DOM.

Grabbing an element by it's ID.



Vanilla JS:

```
document.getElementById("myId");
```

jQuery:

```
$("#myId")
```



As you can see, jQuery uses CSS-like selectors to grab an element.



#### document.querySelector()  & document.querySelectorAll()



You can achieve jQuery's DOM manipulation using Vanilla JS as well, this is why developers are starting to drop jQuery, but chances are you will still encounter it in many projects and many other libraries and plugins depend on it.
